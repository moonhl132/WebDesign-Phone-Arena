              <p>Xiaomi is continuing its rollout of MIUI 11, the latest version of its Android skin, that was initially unveiled back in September.
                The company has been making steady progress in bringing it to as many of its old devices as possible, and today the software is reaching two more models.</p>

              <p>In a few weeks Huawei is expected to unveil the P40 family, and while the spotlight is usually on the namesake as well as the Pro model,
                let's not forget that there's always a Lite phone tagging along for the ride (and added brand cachet).</p>

              <p>OnePlus has started sending out a brand new software update to its devices from the first half of 2019 - the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro.
                Both of these are now in the process of receiving OxygenOS 10.0.3, and we'll warn you straight from the get-go that this isn't a huge update.</p>

              <p>Xiaomi's sub-brand Redmi seems to be in an all-out war with Oppo sub-brand Realme,
                the purpose of which is apparently figuring out which company can churn out more mid-rangers in a set amount of time.
                They're both doing a swell job, and this time around two of Redmi's newest devices have made the trip to our video review studio.</p>

              <p>DxOMark just released its review of the Motorola One Zoom - the company's most versatile and probably its best camera phone for a while.
                 The review, however, says the cameras can't compete with more than half of the phones on in DxOMark's database.</p>
